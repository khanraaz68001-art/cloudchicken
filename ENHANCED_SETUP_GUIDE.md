# ðŸš€ Enhanced Chicken Delivery System Setup Guide

## Step 1: Database Setup

1. **Run the Custom Authentication Schema**
   - Open your Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `complete-custom-auth-schema.sql` first

2. **Run the Enhanced Schema**
   - Then run `enhanced-stock-schema.sql`
   - This creates the new product and stock management system

## Step 2: Storage Setup (For Product Images)

1. **Create Storage Bucket in Supabase**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
   VALUES ('product-images', 'product-images', true);
   ```

2. **Set Storage Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Allow authenticated users to upload images
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects
   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
     bucket_id = 'product-images' 
   );

   -- Allow public access to images
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public access" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');
   ```
